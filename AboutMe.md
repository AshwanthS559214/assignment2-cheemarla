Like some of the other personality typing systems out there, the Enneagram system uses a series of questions based on scenarios to group people into one of nine different interconnected personality groups. As one of the oldest personality typing systems, the Enneagram types are tried and tested and have stood the test of time â€“ from Pythagoras to today.
